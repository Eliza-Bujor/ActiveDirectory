# Active Directory

<h2>Description</h2>
The project involves building a home lab that will benefit both the blue team and general IT. I will demonstrate the step-by-step process of creating my own Active Directory environment, which will aid in understanding IT administration and the workings of a domain. Additionally, I will set up a standalone Splunk instance to ingest events from the Windows server hosting the Active Directory and the target Windows machine. At the end of the project, I will use Kali Linux as the attacking machine to perform a brute force attack, observing the generated telemetry, and also utilize Atomic Red Team.
